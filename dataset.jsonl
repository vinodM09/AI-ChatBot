{"prompt": "What role does weather forecasting play in solar generation planning?", "completion": "Weather forecasts help predict available solar irradiance, enabling better load planning and energy storage management."}
{"prompt": "How does temperature affect battery charging time?", "completion": "Higher temperatures can reduce charging time but may also accelerate degradation. Cooler temperatures increase charging time."}
{"prompt": "How do I calculate the required battery capacity for a load of 10 kW over 4 hours?", "completion": "Multiply the load by the hours: 10 \u00d7 4 = 40 kWh. This is the minimum capacity needed."}
{"prompt": "How do I calculate the energy loss due to wiring resistance?", "completion": "Use the formula P_loss = I\u00b2 \u00d7 R, where I is the current and R is the resistance of the wiring."}
{"prompt": "Why is it important to monitor grid frequency in a microgrid?", "completion": "Monitoring frequency helps ensure stability, prevent outages, and coordinate supply with demand."}
{"prompt": "How do I calculate the required battery capacity for a load of 10 kW over 1 hours?", "completion": "Multiply the load by the hours: 10 \u00d7 1 = 10 kWh. This is the minimum capacity needed."}
{"prompt": "How does inverter efficiency affect total system output?", "completion": "Inverter efficiency determines how much DC power from solar panels is converted to usable AC power. Lower efficiency means more losses."}
{"prompt": "What is the effect of shading on solar panel performance?", "completion": "Shading reduces solar irradiance reaching the panel, leading to lower power output and efficiency."}
{"prompt": "How do I calculate the required battery capacity for a load of 7 kW over 4 hours?", "completion": "Multiply the load by the hours: 7 \u00d7 4 = 28 kWh. This is the minimum capacity needed."}
{"prompt": "How do I calculate the required battery capacity for a load of 7 kW over 5 hours?", "completion": "Multiply the load by the hours: 7 \u00d7 5 = 35 kWh. This is the minimum capacity needed."}
{"prompt": "How can I maintain battery health over time?", "completion": "Maintain proper temperature, avoid deep discharges, and follow manufacturer-recommended charge cycles."}
{"prompt": "What is the relationship between irradiance and solar panel output?", "completion": "Solar panel output is directly proportional to irradiance. Higher irradiance results in more power generation."}
{"prompt": "What is the recommended depth of discharge (DoD) for lithium-ion batteries?", "completion": "Typically, a DoD of 80% or lower is recommended to prolong battery life and avoid excessive wear."}
{"prompt": "How do I calculate the required battery capacity for a load of 3 kW over 4 hours?", "completion": "Multiply the load by the hours: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 kWh. This is the minimum capacity needed."}
